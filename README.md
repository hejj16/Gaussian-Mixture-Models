# Gaussian-Mixture-Models

This repository tries to interpret GMMs from the persperctive of probabilistic graphical models, and using multiple methods to find MAP assignments or parameter estimators.
This repository contains:

- An overview of Gaussian Mixture Models
- Inference or Learning Methods
  - EM Algorithm
  - Mean Field Variational Inference (Coordinate Ascending VI)
    - Theoretical Derivation
    - Python Coding
  - Gibbs Sampling
    - Theoretical Derivation
    - Python Coding
